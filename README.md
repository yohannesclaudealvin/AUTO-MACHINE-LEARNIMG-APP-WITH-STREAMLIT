# AUTO-MACHINE-LEARNIMG-APP-WITH-STREAMLIT
This is a Streamlit application I created, allowing any user to generate a machine learning model without having to code. With this application, you can load your dataset, generate an exploratory data analysis report, and create a machine learning model, whether it's for regression or classification.
